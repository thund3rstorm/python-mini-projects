# Python Mini Projects
This Repo contains some simple mini-projects written in Python3.

## Cricket Game
>If you have played thumb cricket, then you already know the rules
While you are batting:
You have to choose a number between 1 and 6(except 5).
The computer then also chooses a number randomly, if your choice is different from computers then
your number will be added to your score and if computer's choice and your choice of numbers are the same then
you will be declared as OUT!
While Batting:
you have to guess the number what the computer may have chosen, if the number matches then the computer will be declared as OUT!\n
You score just have to be higher than computer's in order to win the match.

## Guess The Number
>Guess the number is a game where you will try to guess the number which Computer has chosen randomly
First you have to choose a range of numbers in between which you are willing to guess, 
then the computer will choose a number in that range and you have to guess it!
The computer will tell you if your guess is higher or lower than actual number.
If the difference in your guess and the actual number is less or greater than 4 the computer will tell you that you are close.
There is an attempt counter in the game to check how many attempts you have taken. Try to guess the number in fewer attempts.

## Rock Paper Scissors Game
>A simple rock paper scissors game, can be played vs COM or you can play with your friend.
